<h2>Why I love dogs</h2>

<p>
I didn’t always understand how strong the bond with a dog can be until Simba became part of my life.
He has a calm personality but also a playful side that surprises me every day.
Sometimes when I feel stressed from school, he just sits next to me quietly and that alone helps a lot.
</p>

<ul>
<li>He makes normal days feel lighter.</li>
<li>Walking him helps me slow down and notice small things.</li>
<li>He reminds me to be patient and present.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
Some days Simba feels like a quiet shadow.
Not loud, not demanding — just present.
</blockquote>

<p>
I chose dogs as my passion because they represent loyalty and emotional connection.
Simba is not just a pet to me — he feels like a quiet companion that understands without words.
