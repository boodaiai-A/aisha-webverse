<h1>Journal / Reading Response</h1>


<h2>Reflection on: My Website is a Shifting House Next to a River of Knowledge</h2>

<p>
In this essay, Laurel Schwulst describes websites as living spaces that grow and change over time instead of fixed finished projects. She compares a website to a house near a river, which made me think about how design can feel personal and flexible. I liked the idea that a site does not need to be perfect or polished to be meaningful.
</p>

<p>
As a design student, this reading made me feel more comfortable experimenting with my own homepage. Instead of trying to make everything look professional right away, I started thinking about my site as something that can evolve as I learn new skills and ideas.

<h2>Reflection on: A Rant About Technology — Ursula K. Le Guin</h2>

<p>
Ursula K. Le Guin writes about how people often misunderstand technology by thinking it only means machines or digital tools. She explains that technology has always existed in creative practices, including writing and art. This made me rethink how I see coding, not just as a technical skill but as part of a larger creative process.
</p>

<p>
The reading reminded me that tools shape how we communicate and express ideas. It helped me see web design as something connected to storytelling rather than just function.

<h2>Reflection on: A Handmade Web — J.R. Carpenter</h2>

<p>
“A Handmade Web” talks about early internet culture and personal websites that felt more experimental and human. The author describes the beauty of imperfect HTML and small independent spaces online. I liked how the essay values individuality instead of commercial design trends.
</p>

<p>
This reading made me reflect on my own website and how I can keep a handmade feeling even while learning new techniques. It reminded me that design does not always need to be polished — sometimes simplicity and personality make a site stronger.

<h2>Reflection on: Against an Increasingly User-Hostile Web</h2>

<p>
In the essay “Against an Increasingly User-Hostile Web,” the author talks about how the internet changed from something open and creative into spaces controlled by platforms and advertising. Many websites today feel like they are designed to keep people scrolling instead of helping them explore freely.
</p>

<p>
One idea that stood out to me was how early websites were more independent and connected through links. Now many online spaces feel closed or focused on tracking users. This made me think about how design decisions affect how people move through a website and what they pay attention to.
</p>

<p>
As a design student, I connected to the discussion about ethical design. The author suggests that designers should make calmer and more respectful digital experiences. I agree with this because good design should support users instead of overwhelming them.
</p>

<p>
Overall, the reading made me reflect on my own approach to web design. Even simple layout or interaction choices can influence how someone feels when they visit a site.

<h2>Reflection on: A Friend Is Typing — Callum Copley</h2>

<p>
In “A Friend Is Typing,” Callum Copley explores how small interface details in messaging apps can shape the way people feel while communicating. The idea that a simple typing indicator can create anticipation made me realize how design choices affect emotional experience online.
</p>

<p>
As a design student, this reading made me think about how interaction design is not only visual but also psychological. Even small interface elements can change how people interpret silence or waiting in conversations.
