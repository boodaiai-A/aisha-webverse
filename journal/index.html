<h3>Reflection on:

Against an Increasingly User-Hostile Web
</a>
</h3>

<p>
In the essay “Against an Increasingly User-Hostile Web,” the author talks about how the internet changed from something open and creative into spaces controlled by platforms and advertising. Many websites today feel like they are designed to keep people scrolling instead of helping them explore freely.
</p>

<p>
One idea that stood out to me was how early websites were more independent and connected through links. Now many online spaces feel closed or focused on tracking users. This made me think about how design decisions affect how people move through a website and what they pay attention to.
</p>

<p>
As a design student, I connected to the discussion about ethical design. The author suggests that designers should make calmer and more respectful digital experiences. I agree with this because good design should support users instead of overwhelming them.
</p>

<p>
Overall, the reading made me reflect on my own approach to web design. Even simple layout or interaction choices can influence how someone feels when they visit a site, so I want to think more carefully about those decisions.

<h3>Reflection on:
<a href="https://a-friend-is-writing.bewe.me" target="_blank">
Callum Copley — A Friend is Writing
</a>
</h3>

<p>
In “A Friend is Writing,” Callum Copley reflects on how writing online can feel personal even when it happens through screens. The reading made me think about how digital communication creates a strange mix of distance and closeness.
</p>

<p>
What stood out to me was the idea of presence — how someone typing somewhere else can still feel emotionally near. It reminded me that design and language both shape how we experience connection online.
</p>

<p>
As a design student, I started thinking about how layout, timing, and interaction influence emotion. Even small interface choices can change how a message feels to the reader.
</p>

<p>
Overall, this reading made me reflect on how online writing is not only about information but also about atmosphere and feeling.
