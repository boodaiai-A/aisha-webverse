Against an Increasingly User-Hostile Web
</a>
</h2>

<p>
In the essay “Against an Increasingly User-Hostile Web,” the author talks about how the internet changed from something open and creative into spaces controlled by platforms and advertising. Many websites today feel like they are designed to keep people scrolling instead of helping them explore freely.
</p>

<p>
One idea that stood out to me was how early websites were more independent and connected through links. Now many online spaces feel closed or focused on tracking users. This made me think about how design decisions affect how people move through a website and what they pay attention to.
</p>

<p>
As a design student, I connected to the discussion about ethical design. The author suggests that designers should make calmer and more respectful digital experiences. I agree because good design should support users instead of overwhelming them.
</p>

<p>
Overall, the reading made me reflect on my own approach to web design. Even simple layout or interaction choices can influence how someone feels when they visit a site.

Reflection on:
<span>Callum Copley — A Friend is Writing</span>
</h2>

<p>
In “A Friend is Writing,” Callum Copley reflects on how online writing can still feel personal even when it happens through screens. The reading made me think about how digital communication creates a mix of distance and closeness.
</p>

<p>
What stood out to me was the idea of presence — how someone typing somewhere else can still feel emotionally near. As a design student, it reminded me that layout, timing, and interaction influence emotion, not just visuals.

Laurel Schwulst — My Website is a Shifting House
</a>
</h2>

<p>
Schwulst describes a website like a personal space that grows over time instead of staying finished. I liked this idea because it makes web design feel more experimental and less perfect.
</p>

<p>
It made me want to treat my homepage like something that can evolve while I learn new skills.

Ursula K. Le Guin — A Rant About Technology
</a>
</h2>

<p>
Le Guin questions how people talk about technology as if it is automatic progress. The reading reminded me that tools are human choices and they shape culture.
</p>

<p>
As a designer, it made me think more critically about what I build and why.

J.R. Carpenter — A Handmade Web
</a>
</h2>

<p>
“A Handmade Web” celebrates small, personal websites and creative independence online. I liked how it values individuality instead of polished commercial design.
</p>

<p>
It made me think about keeping my site personal and experimental while learning new techniques.
