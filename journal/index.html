<h2>Reading Response</h2>

<p>
In the essay “Against an Increasingly User-Hostile Web,” the author talks about
how the internet changed from something open and creative into spaces controlled
by platforms and advertising. Many websites today feel like they are designed
to keep people scrolling instead of helping them explore freely.
</p>

<p>
One idea that stood out to me was how early websites were more independent and
connected through links. Now many online spaces feel closed or focused on
tracking users. This made me think about how design decisions affect how people
move through a website and what they pay attention to.
</p>

<p>
As a design student, I connected to the discussion about ethical design. The
author suggests that designers should make calmer and more respectful digital
experiences. I agree with this because good design should support users instead
of overwhelming them.
</p>

<p>
Overall, the reading made me reflect on my own approach to web design. Even
simple layout or interaction choices can influence how someone feels when they
visit a site, so I want to think more carefully about those decisions.
