Against an Increasingly User-Hostile Web
</a>
</h2>

<p>
In the essay “Against an Increasingly User-Hostile Web,” the author talks about how the internet changed from something open and creative into spaces controlled by platforms and advertising. Many websites today feel like they are designed to keep people scrolling instead of helping them explore freely.
</p>

<p>
One idea that stood out to me was how early websites were more independent and connected through links. Now many online spaces feel closed or focused on tracking users. This made me think about how design decisions affect how people move through a website and what they pay attention to.
</p>

<p>
As a design student, I connected to the discussion about ethical design. The author suggests that designers should make calmer and more respectful digital experiences. I agree because good design should support users instead of overwhelming them.

<a href="#">A Friend Is Typing — Callum Copley</a>
</h2>

<p>
In “A Friend Is Typing,” Callum Copley reflects on how writing online can feel personal even through screens. The reading made me think about how small interface details create emotion and connection.
</p>

<p>
As a design student, it reminded me that layout, timing, and interaction choices can change how a message feels to the reader.

My Website is a Shifting House — Laurel Schwulst
</a>
</h2>

<p>
This reading described websites as evolving personal spaces instead of fixed portfolios. I liked the idea that a website can grow slowly and reflect a person’s thinking over time.
</p>

<p>
It made me feel more comfortable experimenting with my own homepage instead of trying to make it perfect immediately.

A Rant About Technology — Ursula K. Le Guin
</a>
</h2>

<p>
Le Guin questions how people treat technology as something inevitable. The reading made me think about how digital tools shape culture but still come from human choices.
</p>

<p>
As a designer, it reminded me to think critically about tools instead of just following trends.

A Handmade Web — J.R. Carpenter
</a>
</h2>

<p>
“A Handmade Web” celebrates small personal websites and experimental design. I liked how it values individuality instead of commercial polish.
</p>

<p>
This reading encouraged me to keep a handmade feeling in my own web projects while learning new techniques.
